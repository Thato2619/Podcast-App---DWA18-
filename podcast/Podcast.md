Building this Podcast App was definitely a rollercoaster. This project has taught me a lot starting from Tailwind CSS, Next JS, Material UI. Please bare with me, as this my first time really using frameworks. I would be lying if I said, there were no bug, specifcally with routing, and the genres and the routing of that. Overrall please patiently join me for the ride.
