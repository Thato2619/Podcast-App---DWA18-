        "description": "The Alien Adventures of Finn Caspian is a serialized science-fiction story for kids (start with Episode 1), told in 15-20 minute episodes for parents to put on when driving around town, or to marathon on road trips, or to bond over before bed. The story centers on Finn Caspian, an 8-year-old boy aboard The Famous Marlowe 280 Interplanetary Exploratory Space Station. He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe. When pressed, we describe it as a \"mystery gang\" story, sort of like Scooby-Doo in space. The story is written and performed by Jonathan Messinger, author of Hiding Out, former web editor of Time Out Chicago Kids, and father of two boys. His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he's talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works.

Agatha Hannigan (Tony Award winner Laura Benanti) has spent five years in prison, revisiting her bad choices and stewing about the billionaire and his adopted daughter who put her behind bars.

        "description": "Becoming Mother Nature introduced us to troubled 13-year-old Chloe Lovejoy, who prematurely inherited the mantle and awesome power of Mother Nature from her Grandmother Ivy. In season one, Chloe struggled mightily to balance the trials and tribulations of middle school with...you know, saving the world. With Cupid and the Reaper, Volume II of “The Natureverse,” Chloe will soon learn she’s not the only super-powered teenager in the world. Meet thirteen-year-old Mondo Ramirez, a hopeless romantic in Savannah, Georgia, who rarely thinks of consequences. When his elaborate 8th grade promposal goes awry, Mondo accidentally kills the Grim Reaper, inheriting the Reaper’s cloak and scythe in the process. Marcus Aronson never accepted or understood his parents’ divorce. Logical and socially challenged, Marcus went on a mission to find Cupid himself, and finally convinced the winged archer him to hand over his arrows and his title. Armed with research, algorithms and a huge pair of wings, Marcus is determined to change the way people fall in love. Cupid and The Reaper, Volume II of the “Natureverse,” tells the buddy-adventure story of these two mismatched and unlikely heroes. Can Marcus and Mondo learn to work together and harness the powers of life, death and love to fight off a mysterious supernatural force in their school? And will Chloe see them as friends...or foes?
