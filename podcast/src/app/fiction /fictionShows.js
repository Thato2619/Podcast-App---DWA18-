        "description": "Our family members are not always who we think. When Eleonore Richland exposed her father’s dark legacy, she vowed to clean up the family business – and hired her half-brother, Santino Reyes, to help her do it. But old habits die hard. In the shocking new third season, Eleonore reckons with what her father always taught her growing up: medicine is a bloody business. From Wondery, the makers of “The Shrink Next Door” and “Dr. Death,” Blood Ties stars Gillian Jacobs (Community, Love), Christian Navarro (13 Reasons Why), and Peter Stormare. All episodes are available now. You can binge the series ad-free on Wondery+ or on Amazon Music with a Prime membership or Amazon Music Unlimited subscription.",

Now 15, Annie (Abbie Grace Levi), a singer-songwriter/influencer extraordinaire, is about to face the biggest test of her signature positivity when a mystery rocks the Warbucks empire. Annie must rely on her pals from the orphanage, Molly, Tessie and Pepper, and her artificial intelligence “butler” Drake (Alan Ruck, Succession) to save her family. Agatha Hannigan (Tony Award winner Laura Benanti) has spent five years in prison, revisiting her bad choices and stewing about the billionaire and his adopted daughter who put her behind bars. Finally released back into society, Hannigan will have to decide: Does she want to turn her life around, or does she want revenge? From Gen-Z Media, creators of the Peabody Award-winning The Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel and the hit family podcast, Six Minutes, Tomorrow combines the heart, humor and hope of the original stage play with elements of serialized mystery and high stakes adventure.

        "description": "The Last Dog is a thrilling and heartfelt audio adventure with the love story between a girl and a dog at its center. In an apocalyptic future, climate change and overconsumption have made our planet a very different place. The seas have risen, resources are scarce…and animals have disappeared off the face of the earth. Most people believe they never existed at all. 12-year-old Iowa Chapman is not most people. And when she’s rescued by what might be the last remaining dog, she realizes the responsibility she has to keep this amazing creature safe. Pursued by the evil Regulators, Iowa and Doggo set off on a journey in search of Haven, a legendary island where some believe animals might still be living. From Gen-Z Media, creators of Six Minutes, The Last Dog is GZM’s first movie-length audio epic. For more great Gen-Z Media podcasts visit: http://gzmshows.com",
